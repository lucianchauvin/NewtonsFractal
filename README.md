Newtons method is a recursive function that uses the derivitive of a function to solve for its roots. When applying this to the compelx plane, fractals are created by the convergence and divergence of this method. This particular example is being tested with the function z^3 - 1 of roots 1 and -1/2 +/- (i*sqrt(3))/2. Each color in the image repersents which root Newton's method converges to. When creating this, I not only learned about the complex plane and how to work with complex numbers, but also re-discovered Euler's formula and how it can be used.
